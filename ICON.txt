Gem Drop X ICON
---------------
  Feel free to use the "gemdropx-icon.xpm", found in the "gfx/" directory,
  in FVWM's GoodStuff or your favorite window manager's file/program
  manager or program dock.

  Note that "gfx/" is located in the distribution directory, as well as
  in the installed directory, if that was specified at compile-time with
  an "DATA_PREFIX" value.
